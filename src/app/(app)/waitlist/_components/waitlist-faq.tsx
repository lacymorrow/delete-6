	{
		question: "How is this different from other Next.js starters?",
		answer:
			"Most starters give you a basic setup and call it a day. We've built production apps with this stack and fixed all the edge cases. Auth that handles email verification, payments with working webhooks, database migrations that don't break. It's the difference between a demo and something you can ship to customers.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I remove features I don't need?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Everything is modular and documented. Don't need payments? Delete the Stripe folder. Don't want the CMS? Remove Payload. Each feature is self-contained with clear removal instructions.",
	},
	{
		question: "How much time will this save me?",
		answer:
			"Beta testers report 2-4 weeks saved on average. Authentication alone usually takes a week if done right. Add payments, email templates, database setup, deployment configs... One founder launched their MVP in 4 days instead of 2 months.",
	},
	{
		question: "What's the early access pricing?",
		answer:
			"50% off the regular price for early access members, locked in forever. Think 'reasonable for an indie developer, cheap for a team.' Way less than you'd pay a contractor to build this from scratch.",
	},
	{
		question: "When will this be available?",
		answer:
			"March 2025. We're making sure everything works in production rather than rushing to meet a deadline. Better to launch right than launch fast.",
	},
