# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Next.js starter kit, related services, and website (collectively, the "Services"). By using {siteConfig.url}, you consent to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. All use of your personal information is aligned with our Terms and Conditions, which are available for your review anytime.

## 2. Information We Collect

When you sign up, show interest in our offerings, or get in touch, we collect some personal details you provide. Here’s what we might ask for to make your experience smoother and more personalized:

- Email Address
- Names or identifiers
- Profile information
- Job Titles
- Usernames
- Passwords
- Contact Preferences
- Authentication Data
- Billing Addresses
- Any additional information you voluntarily provide (which we assume means you're comfortable sharing it)

### Sensitive Personal Information

We do not process sensitive personal information.

### Information from Third Parties

We do not receive any information from third parties, ensuring your interactions with us remain straightforward and within our control.

### Authentication Data

We integrate with third-party authentication providers because building our own authentication system would require a level of responsibility we're not prepared to assume.

### Usage Data

We collect standard analytics data, which means whatever our analytics providers decide to track this week.

### Payment Information

We don't process sensitive information ourselves, but we do need to collect certain details to process any purchases you make. This includes:

- Payment Instrument Number
- Security Code Associated with Your Payment Instrument

Please note, all payment data is securely stored by our payment processors: LemonSqueezy, Stripe, and Polar. To understand how your payment information is handled, you can view Stripe’s privacy notice here.
