# Database Best Practices

## Data Modeling
- Use meaningful and consistent naming
- Define clear relationships between entities
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement proper indexing
- Consider query patterns
- Plan for scalability
- Document schema design

## Field Types
- Use dates instead of booleans
  - ❌ `isActive: boolean`
  - ✅ `activeAt: Date`
  - ❌ `isDeleted: boolean`
  - ✅ `deletedAt: Date`
- Use enums for fixed values
- Use JSON for flexible structures
- Use proper numeric types
- Consider storage implications

## Field Consistency and Provider Integration
- **ALWAYS** store critical data in multiple compatible fields when dealing with external providers
- **NEVER** assume external systems use your field naming conventions
- Use fallback logic when reading data that could exist in multiple fields
  - ✅ `payment.orderId || payment.processorOrderId || ""`
  - ❌ `payment.orderId ?? ""`
- Document which providers populate which fields in [src/server/providers/](mdc:src/server/providers)
- Test complete data flow from provider import to UI display
- Maintain backward compatibility when adding new fields
- Example from payments table:
  ```typescript
  // Store in both fields for compatibility
  orderId: processorOrderId,           // For display compatibility
  processorOrderId: processorOrderId,  // For provider-specific operations
  ```

## Relationships
- Define foreign key constraints
- Use junction tables for many-to-many
- Consider denormalization when needed
- Document relationship types
- Plan for cascading operations
- Handle circular references
- Consider query performance

## Webhook Data Patterns
- Store webhook event IDs for idempotency checks
- Use database transactions for atomic webhook processing
- Implement proper indexes on webhook event lookup fields
- Store webhook processing status and timestamps
- Use proper data types for webhook payload storage (JSON/JSONB)
- Implement webhook event deduplication at database level
- Create audit trails for webhook-triggered data changes
- Handle webhook event ordering and dependencies
- Use database locks to prevent race conditions in webhook processing
- Store webhook retry attempts and failure reasons

## Querying
- Use parameterized queries
- Optimize query performance
- Use appropriate indexes
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use transactions appropriately
- Handle race conditions
- Monitor query performance

## Security
- Use prepared statements
- Implement row-level security
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper access control
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for vulnerabilities

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks
- Implement retries for transient failures
- Log database errors
- Handle constraint violations
- Implement proper rollbacks
- Monitor for deadlocks
- Document error scenarios

## Performance
- Use appropriate indexes
- Monitor query performance
- Implement caching strategies
- Regular maintenance
- Handle connection pooling
- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize bulk operations

## Migrations
- Version control migrations
- Test migrations thoroughly
- Plan for rollbacks
- Document changes
- Handle data backfills
- Consider downtime impact
- Monitor migration progress

## Backup and Recovery
- Regular backups
- Test recovery procedures
- Document backup strategy
- Monitor backup success
- Plan for disaster recovery
- Regular restore tests
- Maintain backup history

## Monitoring
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up alerts
- Track error rates
- Monitor disk usage
- Check connection pools
- Monitor query patterns
- Regular health checks
