# Markdown and MDX

Shipkit supports Markdown and MDX for content authoring, providing a developer-friendly way to create and manage content.

## Overview

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted content using plain text. MDX extends Markdown by allowing you to include JSX components directly in your content.

## File Structure

Markdown and MDX files in Shipkit are organized in the `src/content` directory:

```
src/content/
├── docs/            # Documentation content
├── blog/            # Blog posts
src/pages/           # Static pages
```

## Creating Content

1. Create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top of the file for metadata
3. Write your content using Markdown syntax
4. For MDX, import and use React components as needed

## Frontmatter

Use frontmatter to define metadata for your content:

```md
---
title: 'My Page Title'
description: 'A brief description of the page'
date: '2023-01-01'
author: 'John Doe'
---

# Content starts here
```

### Blog Post Frontmatter

Blog posts support additional frontmatter fields:

```md
---

# Your blog post content
```

#### Image Support

Blog posts support hero images that appear both in the blog timeline and individual post pages:

- **`image`**: URL to the hero image for the blog post
- Images automatically scale with hover effects
- Responsive sizing for different screen sizes
- Optimized loading with Next.js Image component

You can also include inline images in your blog content using standard Markdown syntax:

```md
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Using Components in MDX

MDX allows you to import and use React components:

```mdx
---
title: 'Interactive Page'
---

import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

# Interactive Content

Click the button below:

<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## Accessing Content

Content created with Markdown and MDX is automatically available at the URL matching its file path:

- `src/content/pages/about.mdx` will be available at `/about`
- `src/content/blog/hello-world.mdx` will be available at `/blog/hello-world`

## Image Guidelines

When using images in blog posts, follow these best practices:

1. **Hero Images**: Use high-quality images with 800x400 aspect ratio
2. **Inline Images**: Use 600x300 for inline content images
3. **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility
4. **Performance**: Use optimized image URLs (WebP format when possible)
5. **Responsive**: Images automatically adapt to different screen sizes
