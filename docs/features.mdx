# Features

## User Interface

### View Transitions

Simply use the `<Link>` component from `@/components/primitives/link-with-transition` and Shipkit will handle the view transitions for you.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@/components/primitives/link-with-transition";
//...
<Link href="/">Home</Link>;
```

### Theme Switcher

Shipkit comes with a theme switcher that allows you to switch between light and dark mode, or use the system theme.

There are two components you can use to switch themes:

```tsx
import { ThemeChooser, ThemeToggle } from "@/components/ui/theme";
```

- `<ThemeToggle>`: This component is used to switch the theme between light and dark mode.
- `<ThemeChooser>`: This component allows you to switch the theme to a specific theme.

### Dynamic Slots

Shipkit allows you to dynamically render slots, without having to touch the layout code.

Just create an intercepting route and shipkit will handle the rest.
