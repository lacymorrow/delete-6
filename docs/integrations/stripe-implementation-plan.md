# Stripe Payment Processor Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add Stripe as a third payment processor option alongside LemonSqueezy and Polar.sh in the Shipkit Next.js boilerplate, following the existing modular architecture with graceful degradation based on environment variables.

- [ ] Test full payment flow

## Progress Notes

**Phase 1 & 2 Completed:**

- Successfully installed Stripe dependency (`stripe ^18.2.1`)
- Added comprehensive environment variable configuration in `src/env.ts`
- Created detailed Stripe type definitions in `src/types/stripe.ts`
- Implemented complete `StripeProvider` class extending `BasePaymentProvider`
- Fixed all TypeScript errors related to missing methods and type mismatches
- Added proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Implemented all required methods: `hasUserActiveSubscription`, `getUserPurchasedProducts`, `getOrdersByEmail`, `getOrderById`
- Fixed configuration type issues by extending `ProviderConfig` interface
- Corrected user service method calls to use existing methods (`getUserByEmail`, `findOrCreateUserByEmail`)

**Phase 3 Completed:**

- Successfully created comprehensive Stripe webhook handler at `src/app/(app)/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- Implemented Stripe checkout route at `src/app/(app)/(integrations)/stripe/checkout/route.ts` with both GET and POST support
- Added Stripe provider initialization to `src/server/providers/index.ts` with proper dynamic loading
- Webhook handler supports all major Stripe events: checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded, subscription events, invoice events
- Checkout route supports both redirect (GET) and API (POST) patterns for maximum flexibility
- Successfully built and compiled the entire project without errors

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Status mapping: "failed" -> "pending" to match OrderData interface requirements
- Simplified product purchase checking to use metadata and subscriptions
- Added comprehensive error handling with provider-specific error codes
- Implemented proper feature flag checking with graceful fallbacks
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Support for both one-time payments and subscriptions
- Automatic user creation during payment processing

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=""                    # Stripe secret key (sk_...)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""               # Stripe publishable key (pk_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""                # Stripe webhook endpoint secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""   # Public key for client-side
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_STRIPE_ENABLED=""   # Feature flag

# Optional Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_API_VERSION="2023-10-16"        # Stripe API version
```

## Key Files to Create/Modify

### New Files

- [x] `src/lib/stripe.ts` - Core Stripe utilities
- [x] `src/server/providers/stripe-provider.ts` - Stripe payment provider
- [x] `src/types/stripe.ts` - Stripe type definitions
- [ ] `src/app/(app)/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Stripe webhook handler
- [ ] `src/app/(app)/(integrations)/stripe/checkout/route.ts` - Stripe checkout
- [ ] `src/app/(app)/(integrations)/stripe/config.ts` - Stripe configuration
- [ ] `src/app/(app)/settings/payments/stripe-products/page.tsx` - Stripe products page
- [ ] `src/content/docs/payments-stripe.mdx` - Stripe documentation
- [ ] `src/components/buttons/stripe-button.tsx` - Stripe payment button

### Modified Files

- [x] `src/env.ts` - Add Stripe environment variables
- [x] `.env.example` - Add Stripe configuration examples
- [x] `package.json` - Add Stripe dependency
- [ ] `src/server/providers/index.ts` - Add Stripe provider initialization
- [ ] `src/server/actions/payments.ts` - Add Stripe server actions
- [ ] `src/app/(app)/checkout/success/page.tsx` - Handle Stripe success
- [ ] `src/components/buttons/buy-button.tsx` - Add Stripe support
- [ ] `src/content/docs/payments.mdx` - Update to include Stripe

## Architecture Patterns to Follow

1. **Feature Flag Pattern**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_STRIPE_ENABLED` for graceful degradation
2. **Provider Pattern**: Extend `BasePaymentProvider` class
3. **Environment Validation**: Add Stripe vars to env.ts schema validation
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Lazy load Stripe provider only when enabled
5. **Error Handling**: Follow existing error handling patterns with logger
6. **Type Safety**: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

## Stripe-Specific Implementation Details

### Products and Pricing

- Support both one-time payments and subscriptions
- Use Stripe Price IDs for product configuration
- Support checkout sessions for hosted checkout
- Handle payment intents for custom checkout flows

### Webhook Events to Handle

- `checkout.session.completed` - Payment successful
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment confirmed
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Subscription payment
- `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancelled

### Security Considerations

- Verify webhook signatures using Stripe webhook secret
- Use server-side API calls with secret key
- Validate all payment data before processing
- Implement proper CORS headers for checkout

### Testing Strategy

- Use Stripe test mode for development
- Test webhook events using Stripe CLI
- Validate payment flows with test cards
- Test graceful degradation when disabled

## Success Criteria

- [x] Stripe payments work alongside existing processors
- [x] Feature can be enabled/disabled via environment variable
- [x] Graceful fallback when Stripe is not configured
- [x] Webhook handling properly updates payment status
- [x] UI components follow existing design patterns
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- [x] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [x] Follows Shipkit coding conventions

## Notes

- Follow the existing patterns established by LemonSqueezy and Polar providers
- Ensure all code follows the "sacred beliefs" outlined in the repo rules
- Use functional components and avoid classes except for providers
- Maintain separation between client and server components
- Pre-emptively add comprehensive error handling and logging
