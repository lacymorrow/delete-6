# Web Workers

Web Workers are a way to run JavaScript code in the background, without blocking the main thread. This is useful for performing tasks that are computationally intensive or time-consuming, such as image processing or data analysis.

Shipkit is pre-configured to build Typescript Web Workers from the `src/workers` directory into the `public/workers` directory, so it will automatically load the workers when the app is built.

## Example

<FileTree
  files={[
    { path: "src/workers/logger-worker.ts", type: "file" },
    { path: "public/workers/logger-worker.js", type: "file" },
  ]}
/>

The `logger-worker.ts` file is an example of a web worker that handles logging operations in batches to reduce API calls. It automatically flushes logs every 5 seconds or when reaching a specified batch size.
